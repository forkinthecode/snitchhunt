<details><summary><h5>About</h5></summary>

<p><a href='http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-team-of-pre-teens-found-whisteblower-using-metadata/8113668' target='_blank'>SnitchHunt</a> is a game designed by secruity consultant, Gabor Szathmari to teach the public about how different sets
of metadata can be brought together to identify & track the movements of individuals.</p>
<p>The original version of SnitchHunt was taken offline due to costs of hosting because it relied on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibana'>Kibana</a> to allow 
	users to search against the datasets. </p>
	<p>It was for this reason that I decided to create a different version of the game that did not use Kibana so that 
		it could be kept online indefinitely.  </p>
<p>I also decided to add a simpler, quicker 'game' based on the SnitchHunt data that can be run in evening time-slots.</p>
<p>The <a href='index.php#a9'>short/easy version</a> is suitable for evening timeslots, the <a href='index.php#a10'>longer much harder version</a> is suitable for day-long events.</p>
<p>Either version can be done online at your leisure, just follow the introductory slides through to get the gist.</p>
<p>The easy version does not require log in and is not scored. The difficult version requires sign up to keep track of scoring so is a more competitive type of event.</p>
<p>My version of SnitchHunt is currently open sourced at <a href='https://github.com/forkinthecode/snitchhunt'>GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Rosie Williams has a degree in Sociology (inequality, public policy) and programming skills in PHP, MySQL, CSS & HTML. </p>
