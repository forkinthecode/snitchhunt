<p>You are on the train heading home when your phone starts buzzing. You  got a text from your boss, who is asking you to take a look at your work emails. You reluctantly open your mailbox only to find the following email:</p>

<div class='phone'>  
	<div class='task'>
<p><strong>From: Finn Coburn &lt;finn.coburn&#64;thepolice.com&gt;</strong><br />
<p><strong>To: data-analysts&#64;thepolice.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subject: Fixing a leak at Minecorp</strong>  </p>
<p>Good morning analysts,</p>
<p>Apologies for the email on the weekend. I am just off the phone with the chief and I need you to work on something asap.</p>
<p>It seems there is a whistleblower at Minecorp leaking to a journalist at MineWatch. Here is the article that just came out yesterday evening:</p>
<p>Anna Dupont: Whistleblower Reveals that Minecorp's WA Fracking Operation Uses Toxic Chemicals (next page)</p>
<p>May I remind you that the mines in Australia are all critical infrastructure, and those leaked docs cannot get into the wrong hands on the black market. 
	Therefore, we need to identify the person of interest to put him/her under arrest.</p>
<p>So I need you to dig this guy up for me. As some of you are new hires here, let me reiterate again what is expected from you to do:</p>
<p>We need to know who has been in contact with the journalist. We have taken the data from the cell tower location at <b>Bungana Drive</b> near the mine and we need to match it
against the calls to and from the journalist to see if we can narrow it down to a suspect.</p>
<p>
<!--
<p><strong>#1</strong>. Open up the Google metadata search page. 
  
   This brings up Google's records of what people have searched for. The article should come handy to find the right person.
</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong>. To get the email address of the whistleblower, switch to the email metadata logs (yay, we plugged <em>smalllake.com.au</em> in recently!). 
</p>-->
<p><strong>#1</strong>. You will need to read the article (next page) to get the name of the journalist. </p>
<p><strong>#2</strong>. You will need to dig into the phone subscriber data (last page) to get the full information on the journalist.  </p>

<p><strong>#3</strong>. You will need to use the journalists phone number search the phone usage data to find out who has been in contact with her. </p>

<p><strong>#4</strong>. Once you have the results for calls made to cell towers around the mine, plug it into the phone subscriber data base to identify our potential suspect. </p>
<!--
<p><strong>#4</strong>. What is the last known location of the whistleblower? We may need to ring a judge in a different state for the warrant. Also, we could pull a couple of fresh photos of the target from the CCTV cams nearby. Try to get this from the mobile call logs. </p>
<p><strong>#5</strong>. How many times did the journalist and this whistleblower talk to each other over the phone? To answer this you will need use the cross search page.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong>. Is there any other whistleblower who might be also leaking to MineWatch? Use the cross search to find the number that has called both numbers.</p>
  
<p> You will need to solve the challenges in order to find the solutions. </p>-->
