 <div class='homer'><h2 >Learn</h2>
<p>Check out the metadata page to see what data is collected and who has access to it.
    The data that is being collected includes IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and location data. 
  Although these individual datasets already reveal a lot of your online presence, the real deal is data correlation. Once an experienced analyst begins correlating the different datasets, 
    your activities throughout the day can be reconstructed.</p>
  
<p>It's easy to ignore that so much information about us is collected and stored. SnitchHunt was created to educate the public about the reality of what metadata retention really means.
   Play the game to find out how people can be tracked through their digital breadcrumbs.</p>

 </div>
 
 <div class='homer'><h2 >Play</h2>
<p>Snitchhunt puts you in the shoes of a data analyst working for the federal police, using this data to solve the challenges. You will need to dig into, 
  correlate and pivot on the various metadata sets to catch a whistleblower.</p>
<p>Read the article and instructions carefully!  
  Good luck!</p>
