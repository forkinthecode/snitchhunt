# snitchhunt

Snitchhunt is a game desgined by Gabor Szathmari of CryptoParty Sydney to demonstrate how metadata that is kept on every one of us can
be used to track our movements. I discovered Snitchunt at the recent event run by Melbourne University which generated these media stories:

* http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-team-of-pre-teens-found-whisteblower-using-metadata/8113668 
* http://www.startupsmart.com.au/technology/hackathon-exposes-how-easily-you-can-be-found-with-metadata/


This is my implementation of that game intended to be cheaper to host than the original version so the game can be kept online. 
The original version at snitchhunt.org is due to be taken down in coming days. 

My version of Snitchhunt is at http://whistleblower.network/snitch/index.php
