 <p>It's easy to ignore that so much information about us is collected and stored. SnitchHunt was created
  to educate the public about how our everyday activities are being recorded and what this may mean for us.
  Snitchhunt puts you in the shoes of a data analyst working for the federal police, using this data to solve the challenges. </p>
<p>You will need to dig into,
